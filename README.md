## Symptoms Test
User must answer several questions regarding their symptoms and general information about them, this test is good at diagnosing general sickness and sicknesses similar to COVID-19, however it is not perfect as sicknesses that exhibit similar symptoms to COVID-19 will be hard for the neural network to distinguish between. This is where the cough test comes in.

## Cough Test
User must cough into their microphone and answer 3 simple questions. This test works best when sickness is given, so thats why taking the symptoms test beforehand is advised.
